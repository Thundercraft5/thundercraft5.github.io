			<h1 class="center">ðŸŒ± What farming means to me</h1>
            <p class="qoute" author="Masanobu Fukuoka">The ultimate goal of farming is not the growing of crops, but the cultivation and perfection of human beings</p>

            Farming to me is not just a means, or even a way of life, it is an path and end in itself. I see the world and a dire need for integrity and sustainability, and organic, regenerative, and sustainable farming is one of the most powerful ways to achieve this because it is the first and final art of mankind, it was there when we built very first our towns long ago and will always be there when we are cruising amongst the stars and colonizing mars with advanced technology far, far from Earth. It sustains our very existence in the world, it is the root of our civilization.

            <h2 class="center">How I got sparked</h2>
            Over several years my passion for the regenerative food system has evolved into a unwavering conviction in its ability to profoundly heal and uplift lives. My journey into slow food began with Amish Farms when I was 16. It really took off when I visited Polyface Farms in Virginia, where the beauty of the place was nothing but divine, specifically the earthy, rich smell of the soil, the vibrant energy of the people, and the verdant summer landscape. I felt called and embraced it as my path, resonating with my childhood nature-based education and my commitment to integrity and health. To test the water last fall I volunteered at the Queen's County Farm Museum. Through helping with winter clean-ups, I gained a deeper appreciation for teamwork in the field. At home I built a hÃ¼gelkultur bed and prepared our small garden beds for winter by mulching after planting some garlic.

It is now just after new years. 2026 has begun. As I reflect on the past year, I noticed some things about the state of note-taking applications and the culture surrounding them.The proliferation of tools designed to help us capture and organize our thoughts has led to an unexpected consequence: an inflation of meta-knowledge, and an increase in meta-notes without a corresponding increase in our actual, substantial note content.

I am a long-time Obsidian user for several years now, I have experimented with my own note taking system and learned first-hand the risks of meta-knowledge without knowledge. Obsidian, with it's highly configurable plugin system and vast ecosystem of developers, has enabled users to create custom note taking sytems with plugins [Dataview](https://obsidian.md/plugins/dataview), [Templater](https://obsidian.md/plugins/templater), and graph visualization tools.

In the Obsidian community, the habit of merely collecting content with the intention to some day access it later which in practice is never actually accessed is popularly termed the **collector's fallacy**. The term is arguably insufficient for the exact phenomenon. Obsidian has alot of metadata capabilities and this leads to the actual problem I highlight wish to here: **the excess of meta-content, meta-knowledge, metadata without meaningful content, knowledge, and data**. 

### Table of contents

### Meta-knowledge and Knowledge and Notes In Obsidian
An obsidian user might have 1000 notes on various ideas with many links and many MOCs and it might look quite aesthetically pleasing on the graph—humorously termed "*data porn*"—but the actual contents of the notes are meaningless. Even granted these notes contain meaningful content and knowledge, the knowledge not only must be applicable but also understood. Many people are able to articulate their knowledge, but are not able to understand or apply it effectively. 

This is termed *inert knowledge*, by philosopher [Alfred North Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/Alfred_North_Whitehead), first descirbed in 1929:
> Theoretical ideas should always find important applications within the pupil’s curriculum. This is not an easy doctrine to apply, but a very hard one. It contains within itself the problem of keeping knowledge alive, of preventing it from becoming inert, which is the central problem of all education.
> —A. N. Whitehead, 1929

Psychologically speaking it is very easy for one to fall into the trap that having an in-depth understanding of the organization, linking, and mapping of MOCs (*Maps of Content*, a note which acts as an index for other notes of a similar topic) implies that one also has an in-depth understanding of one's own knowledge, especially when doing so via the **graph view** in Obsidian. Knowledge about knowledge is *Meta-knowledge*, which encompasses aspects such as knowledge of the relationship between different topics or disciplines, the ability to understand the limits of one's own knowledge, or to distinguish between differnt types of knowledge.  

The trap is even deeper when the user confuses *meta-knowledge* for the depth of their actual, concrete knowledge of the world. A person can establish a framework for understanding what is information, data, facts, and knowledge and be quite proficient at it yet all the while lacking in the fundemental knowledge they wish to categorize. Or more insidiously, they can mistake that the knowledge they possess and can categorize, link, and graph is practically understood, granting the illusion of deep and higher-order understanding when their knowledge or even meta-knowledge is inert.

### Wisdom vs. Knowledge and Meta-Knowledge
We must also distinguish between **wisdom** and **knowledge**, especially **wisdom** and **meta-knowledge**. Wisdom is a far more holistic and and qualitatively different aspect of human intelligence, encompassing ethical, evaluative, aesthetic, practical, and contextual understanding which exceeds knowledge even meta-knowledge. As the organizational tools of Obsidian can create the illusion of meta-knowledge when that meta-knowledge is actually inert, this can lead to the further illusion that one's meta-knowledge implies wisdom. 

While this problem seems to theaten Obsidian's (and other such note-taking apps like **Notion**) utility and value, we must remind ourselves abuse does not take away use (*Abusus non tollit usum*). The practical solution is to remind ourselves, a note is just a map of our knowledge and does nto replace it, like how a second brain and not our actual brain. **The map is not the territory**, even if you have the most comprehensive and beautiful vault with excellent knowledge and meta-knowledge, it could very well be inert, and you still could easily lack the wisdom to make good use of it.

It is important to not only have knowledge and meta-knowledge, but knowledge of one's own ignorance, and meta-knowledge of one's own meta-ignorance. As we live in such an information rich day and age it is not sufficient to merely to tell ourselves "I know that I know nothing", we must also tell ourselves "I know that I nothing about my meta-knowledge." This is nessecary because the more complex the map, the more likely we are to have a blind spot, and blindly fall into the proverbial hole.

### The Paradox of Wisdom in the Modern Era
The modern era has produced a peculiar paradox in people, where we are absolutely flooded and overwhelmed with information, facts, and data and we paradoxically can make little sense or application of it. Even with sophisticated systems such as note-taking, we still likely struggle. That is simply due to the lack of wisdom, as modern schools currently do not go to the nessecary lengths of teaching classical texts or teaching practices such as self-inquiry and reflection. This produces ignorance of one's own knowledge, while self-reflection strives for knowledge of one's own ignorance.

Classical texts such as *Tao Te Ching* teach that wisdom is frequently what is called subtractive (*Apohpatic*) understanding:
> In the pursuit of learning one knows [Adds] more every day;
> In the pursuit of the way [Wisdom] one loses [Knowledge or Information or Facts] every day.
> —*Tao Te Ching*, Ch. 48

Modern information consumption is primarily constructive (*Cataphatic*), it builds upward and outward. As we advance in our understanding, it will become nessecary to remove, to unlearn, to discard things we previously learned. This is where wisdom comes in, when we unlearn that which we no longer need we arrive at a distilled, essentialized understanding of the subject. This places less cognitive load on the mind and allows us to *focus*. 

Modern note-taking tools if not carefully used without the ability to unlearn and bearing in mind the map of our knowledge is not the territory, this leads to the overload and fragmentation effect we so commonly today where the breadth of knowledge increases daily and the depth of wisdom decreases daily.

### The Rise of AI
This past 12 months have been an absolute boon for LLMs and specifically LLM-driven note-taking and they have reached a saturation point in the market by now in 2026. An LLM despite it's recent advancements in reasoning is still funementally imitative, it cannot easily without significant human assistance generate novel, unexpected, or creative insights. There is currently a big drive towards utilizing LLMs in Obsidian and there are many plugins which have been developed for this purpose. Often they are geared for automatically summarizing websites, other notes, and generating MOCs. 

Due the the firm fact that an LLM does not have the same type of understanding as a concious human does currently, and that an AI will often miss naunces in summarizing a user's notes in which only the user might have sufficient knowledge of the authorial intent to properly understand it, this carries the large risk of further perpetuating the illusion of presence of substantive knowledge and meta-knowledge while in reality it might be inert or entirely absent. 

Due to the relative ease of utilizing both local and cloud LLMs, there will certainly when utilized without discipline, a proliferation in meta-notes without meaningful content, leading to the effect of "meta-content without meaningful content". 

This is why older methods such as Zettlekasten insist on the **friction** of the user writing notes **in their own words** to force them to cognitively "lock" the knowledge in their minds as they put their knowledge in the note, ensuring the "map" of the note corresponds to the "territory" of the person's actual knowledge.

### Practical Tips for Obsidian Users
In order to prevent over-proliferation of one's notes, it is important to frequently distill and reduce one's notes to their essential contents and keep the expansion and commentary elsewhere. It is a good practice as it will test your understanding. In a qoute frequently attributed to Einstein or Feynman: if that if you cannot explain a concept to an 8th grader you do not have a proper understanding of it. While this is a modern cliché and often passed around without much thought or regard it reflects a deeper meaning to knowledge which contrasts with the systematic, ever-expanding note systems we have in our era, and that simplicity is ultimately the goal, not complexity.

You must work constantly to be disciplined to avoid the **collector's fallacy**, and you must always remember that your notes are an incomplete, imperfect representation (a map) of your actual knowledge while always striving for the best possible fidelity. 

Ask if the metadata and meta-content you have is meaningful. If it is merely for the sake of aesthetic purposes or the meta-content generated by an AI summary is irrelevant, delete it. It is better to have a smaller set of lean notes than a larger set of bloated ones. 

### A set of aphorisms to remind Ourselves
As I was writing this blog it came to me that I could demonstrate grammatically, why a meta-note without any meaningful content is absurd. So we may thus say "A note which notes notes of notes notes nothing.". This punchy little aphorism, if you pronounce it aloud sounds like gibberish. Let's unpack to understand the meaning of this mysterious little phrase.


At first glance, this sounds like gibberish. But it is a grammatically rigorous trap—an **autopolyptoton**. Let’s dismantle the recursion, The autopolyptoton works through five grammatical positions:
1. **Subject (Actor):** "The note" — establishes what is acting
2. **Verb (Action):** "notes" — establishes that it is acting
3. **Direct Object (The Acted Upon):** "notes of notes" — reveals the trap: it acts only upon itself
4. **Prepositional/Genitive (Category/Origin):** "of notes" — confirms the circularity: the origin is also itself
5. **Result (Conclusion):** "notes nothing" — the logical consequence: acting only upon itself produces no change, no referent, nothing real

This creates an **infinite recursion without grounding**—like a Droste effect or Matryoshka doll that never reaches a base case. The structure forces you to see: when a word refers only to versions of itself, it has no actual object and therefore accomplishes nothing.

For those interested in the rhetorical structure, this is an **Autopolyptoton**—an aggressive variant of the traditional **polyptoton**. Where a polyptoton plays with different senses of a word, an autopolyptoton repeats the same word in identical sense across subject, verb, object, and category, forcing the mind to confront its own recursive collapse.

Here are several other **Autopolyptotons** I have constructed to help keep our tools in their lanes:
1. **Plugins:** "The plugin which plugins plugins of plugins plugins nothing; the plugin which plugins the work produces the result."
2. **Capturing:** "The capture which captures the capture of captures captures nothing; the capture which captures the moment captures the meaning."
3. **Linking:** "The link which links links of links links nothing; the link which links ideas links insight."
4. **Systematizing:** "The system which systems systems of systems systems nothing; the system which systems the chaos produces the order."
5. **Mapping:** "The map which maps maps of maps maps nothing; the map which maps the territory maps the truth."
6. **Reflection:** "Reflection which reflects reflections of reflections reflects nothing; reflection which reflects toward the actual transforms the self."
7. **Summarizing:** "the summary which summarizes summaries of summaries summarizes nothing; the summary which summarizes toward understanding distills the true."

These are useful to remember precisely because they force the mind to endure the logical consequences of its own recursion. When you speak or build systems this way, grammar itself becomes your teacher—showing you where you've lost the ground and where to return to. We are drifting toward a belief that the accumulation of data is, in itself, the highest good—a philosophy known as Dataism, manifested in the LLM/AI boom and the culture of quantified self. But why we have come to worship the flow of data over the depth of wisdom is a question for another time.

It is now just after New Year's. 2026 has begun. As I reflect on the past year, I noticed some things about the state of note-taking applications and the culture surrounding them. The proliferation of tools designed to help us capture and organize our thoughts has led to an unexpected consequence: an inflation of meta-knowledge, and an increase in meta-notes without a corresponding increase in our actual, substantial note content.

I have been a long-time Obsidian user for several years now. I have experimented with my own note-taking system and learned first-hand the risks of meta-knowledge without knowledge. Obsidian, with its highly configurable plugin system and vast ecosystem of developers, has enabled users to create custom note-taking systems with plugins like [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), [Templater](https://github.com/silentvoid13/templater), and complex graph visualization tools.

In the Obsidian community, the habit of merely collecting content with the intention to access it later—which in practice is never actually accessed—is popularly termed the **collector's fallacy**. However, this term is arguably insufficient for the exact phenomenon. Obsidian has a lot of metadata capabilities, and this leads to the actual problem I wish to highlight here: **the excess of meta-content, meta-knowledge, and metadata without meaningful content, knowledge, and data**.

### Table of contents

### Meta-knowledge and Knowledge and Notes In Obsidian
An Obsidian user might have 1,000 notes on various ideas with many links and MOCs (Maps of Content), and it might look quite aesthetically pleasing on the graph (humorously termed "*graph porn*"), but the actual contents of the notes are meaningless. Even granted that these notes contain meaningful content, the knowledge must not only be applicable but also understood. Many people are able to articulate their knowledge but are not able to understand or apply it effectively.

This is termed *inert knowledge* by philosopher [Alfred North Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead), first described in 1929:
> Theoretical ideas should always find important applications within the pupil’s curriculum. This is not an easy doctrine to apply, but a very hard one. It contains within itself the problem of keeping knowledge alive, of preventing it from becoming inert, which is the central problem of all education.
> —A. N. Whitehead, 1929

Psychologically speaking, it is very easy to fall into the trap of believing that an in-depth understanding of the organization, linking, and mapping of MOCs implies an in-depth understanding of one's own knowledge. This is especially true when doing so via the **graph view** in Obsidian. Knowledge about knowledge is *Meta-knowledge*, which encompasses aspects such as knowledge of the relationship between different topics, the ability to understand the limits of one's own knowledge, or the ability to distinguish between different types of knowledge.

The trap is even deeper when the user confuses *meta-knowledge* for the depth of their actual, concrete knowledge of the world. A person can establish a framework for understanding what is information, data, facts, and knowledge and be quite proficient at it, yet all the while lacking in the fundamental knowledge they wish to categorize. Or more insidiously, they can mistake the knowledge they can categorize, link, and graph for knowledge that is practically understood, granting the illusion of deep and higher-order understanding when their knowledge—or even their meta-knowledge—is inert.

### Wisdom vs. Knowledge and Meta-Knowledge
We must also distinguish between **wisdom** and **knowledge**, and especially between **wisdom** and **meta-knowledge**. Wisdom is a far more holistic and qualitatively different aspect of human intelligence, encompassing ethical, evaluative, aesthetic, practical, and contextual understanding which exceeds knowledge and meta-knowledge. As the organizational tools of Obsidian can create the illusion of meta-knowledge when that meta-knowledge is actually inert, this can lead to the further illusion that one's meta-knowledge implies wisdom.

While this problem seems to threaten Obsidian's (and other such note-taking apps like **Notion**) utility and value, we must remind ourselves that abuse does not take away use (*Abusus non tollit usum*). The practical solution is to remind ourselves that a note is just a map of our knowledge and does not replace it; it acts as a "second brain," not our actual brain. **The map is not the territory**. Even if you have the most comprehensive and beautiful vault with excellent knowledge and meta-knowledge, it could very well be inert, and you could still easily lack the wisdom to make good use of it.

It is important to not only have knowledge and meta-knowledge, but knowledge of one's own ignorance, and meta-knowledge of one's own meta-ignorance. As we live in such an information-rich age, it is not sufficient merely to tell ourselves "I know that I know nothing"; we must also tell ourselves "I know that I know nothing about my meta-knowledge." This is necessary because the more complex the map, the more likely we are to have a blind spot and blindly fall into the proverbial hole.

### The Paradox of Wisdom in the Modern Era
The modern era has produced a peculiar paradox where we are absolutely flooded with information, facts, and data, yet we paradoxically can make little sense or application of it. Even with sophisticated systems such as note-taking apps, we still struggle. That is simply due to the lack of wisdom, as modern schools currently do not go to the necessary lengths of teaching classical texts or teaching practices such as self-inquiry and reflection. This produces ignorance of one's own knowledge, while self-reflection strives for knowledge of one's own ignorance.

Classical texts such as *Tao Te Ching* teach that wisdom is frequently what is called subtractive (*Apophatic*) understanding:
> In the pursuit of learning one knows [Adds] more every day;
> In the pursuit of the way [Wisdom] one loses [Knowledge or Information or Facts] every day.
> —*Tao Te Ching*, Ch. 48

Modern information consumption is primarily constructive (*Cataphatic*); it builds upward and outward. As we advance in our understanding, it becomes necessary to remove, to unlearn, to discard things we previously learned. This is where wisdom comes in: when we unlearn that which we no longer need, we arrive at a distilled, essentialized understanding of the subject. This places less cognitive load on the mind and allows us to *focus*.

Modern note-taking tools, if used without the ability to unlearn and without bearing in mind that the map of our knowledge is not the territory, lead to the overload and fragmentation effect we see so commonly today: the breadth of knowledge increases daily, while the depth of wisdom decreases daily.

### The Rise of AI
The past 12 months have been an absolute boon for LLMs and specifically LLM-driven note-taking, and they have reached a saturation point in the market by now in 2026. An LLM, despite its recent advancements in reasoning, is still fundamentally imitative; without significant human assistance, it cannot easily generate novel, unexpected, or creative insights. There is currently a big drive towards utilizing LLMs in Obsidian, and many plugins have been developed for this purpose. Often, they are geared toward automatically summarizing websites or other notes, and generating MOCs.

Because an LLM currently lacks the same type of understanding as a conscious human, and because an AI will often miss nuances in summarizing a user's notes (where only the user might have sufficient knowledge of the authorial intent), this carries a large risk. It perpetuates the illusion of substantive knowledge and meta-knowledge while in reality, the understanding might be inert or entirely absent.

Due to the relative ease of utilizing both local and cloud LLMs, there will certainly be—when utilized without discipline—a proliferation of meta-notes without meaningful content. 

This is why older methods such as **Zettelkasten** insist on the **friction** of the user writing notes **in their own words**. This forces the user to cognitively "lock" the knowledge in their minds as they put it into the note, ensuring the "map" corresponds to the "territory" of the person's actual knowledge.

### Practical Tips for Obsidian Users
In order to prevent the over-proliferation of notes, it is important to frequently distill and reduce one's notes to their essential contents and keep the expansion and commentary elsewhere. It is a good practice as it will test your understanding. A concept frequently attributed to Einstein or Feynman states that if you cannot explain a concept simply (to an 8th grader), you do not have a proper understanding of it. While this is a modern cliché, it reflects a deep truth about knowledge which contrasts with the systematic, ever-expanding note systems of our era.

You must work constantly to be disciplined to avoid the **collector's fallacy**, and you must always remember that your notes are an incomplete, imperfect representation (a map) of your actual knowledge, while always striving for the best possible fidelity.

Ask if the metadata and meta-content you have is meaningful. If it is merely for aesthetic purposes, or if the meta-content generated by an AI summary is irrelevant, delete it. It is better to have a smaller set of lean notes than a larger set of bloated ones.

### A set of aphorisms to remind Ourselves
As I was writing this blog, it occurred to me that I could demonstrate, grammatically, why a meta-note without any meaningful content is absurd. We may thus say: 

> "A note which notes notes of notes notes nothing." 

This punchy little aphorism, if you pronounce it aloud, sounds like gibberish. But it is a grammatically rigorous trap—a structure I call the **Autopolyptoton**. 

I coined this term to describe a specific, dangerous loop where language consumes itself. Let’s dismantle the recursion. The Autopolyptoton works through five grammatical positions:

1.  **Subject (Actor):** "The note" — establishes what is acting.
2.  **Relative Verb (Action):** "notes" — establishes the recording mechanism.
3.  **Direct Object (The Acted Upon):** "notes of notes" — reveals the trap: it acts only upon representations of itself.
4.  **Prepositional/Genitive (Category/Origin):** "of notes" — confirms the circularity: the origin is also itself.
5.  **Main Verb & Result (Conclusion):** "notes nothing" — the logical consequence: acting only upon itself produces no change, no referent, nothing real.

This creates an **infinite recursion without grounding**—like a Droste effect or Matryoshka doll that never reaches a base case. The structure forces you to see: when a word refers only to versions of itself, it has no actual object and therefore accomplishes nothing.

Here are several other **Autopolyptotons** I have constructed to help keep our tools in their lanes:

1.  **Plugins:** "The plugin which plugins plugins of plugins plugins nothing; the plugin which plugins the work produces the result."
2.  **Capturing:** "The capture which captures the capture of captures captures nothing; the capture which captures the moment captures the meaning."
3.  **Linking:** "The link which links links of links links nothing; the link which links ideas links insight."
4.  **Systematizing:** "The system which systems systems of systems systems nothing; the system which systems the chaos produces the order."
5.  **Mapping:** "The map which maps maps of maps maps nothing; the map which maps the territory maps the truth."
6.  **Reflection:** "Reflection which reflects reflections of reflections reflects nothing; reflection which reflects toward the actual transforms the self."
7.  **Summarizing:** "The summary which summarizes summaries of summaries summarizes nothing; the summary which summarizes toward understanding distills the true."

These are useful precisely because they force the mind to endure the logical consequences of its own recursion. When you speak or build systems this way, grammar itself becomes your teacher—showing you where you've lost the ground and where to return to. We are drifting toward a belief that the accumulation of data is, in itself, the highest good—a philosophy known as Dataism, manifested in the LLM/AI boom and the culture of quantified self. But why we have come to worship the flow of data over the depth of wisdom is a question for another time.

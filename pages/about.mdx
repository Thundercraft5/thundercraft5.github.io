# 👤 About Thundercraft5
I am an open-source developer and aspiring farmer with interests in web development, cybersecurity, slow food, and regenerative agriculture. My journey began with a passion for creating innovative solutions and contributing to the open-source community. Over the years I have worked on various projects ranging from personal experiments to large online communities, including the [Hypixel SkyBlock Wiki](https://hypixel-skyblock.fandom.com/wiki/Hypixel_SkyBlock_Wiki).

## 🌱 My Interests
- **Open-Source Development**: I love contributing to open-source projects and sharing my work with the community. Check out my [work page](/work) to see some of my contributions.
- **Cybersecurity**: I am motivated by a need to secure infrastructure against both emerging and established threats with new technologies such as [Fully Homomorphic Encryption](/fhe). 
- **Regenerative Agriculture**: I am passionate about sustainable farming practices that restore and enhance the health of our ecosystems. Learn more about my journey in farming on my [farming page](/farming).

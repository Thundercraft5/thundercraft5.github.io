# 👤 About Thundercraft5
I'm an open-source developer with a passion for building resilient, sustainable systems—whether they're digital infrastructure or living soil. My interests bridge the worlds of technology and nature, from cybersecurity and web development to slow food and philosophy.- **As a farmer**: My journey here began with an encounter with Amish food which forever changed my life. Over the past year I have participated in WWOOF stays and gone to various regenerative farming events so I may give that experience in turn to others one day.

My path has been shaped by two parallel passions. As a developer, I thrive on building innovative solutions and have contributed to projects for large online communities like the [Hypixel SkyBlock Wiki](https://hypixel-skyblock.fandom.com). But my perspective was forever changed by an encounter with Amish food—a taste of what real, living food could be. That moment sparked my journey into regenerative agriculture, leading me to WWOOF on farms and learn practices I hope to one day share with others.

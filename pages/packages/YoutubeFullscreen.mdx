## YoutubeFullscreen

A lightweight extension for opening YouTube videos in a fullscreen overlay or separate window. This package is maintained in a small repository and is intended for simple integration into web projects.

- **Repository:** <GithubLink url="https://github.com/Thundercraft5/YoutubeFullscreen" />
- **Package name:** `YoutubeFullscreen`

## Install

Install from the project's Releases (CRX or ZIP). Below are the platform-specific instructions summarized from the repository README.

### Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)

- Note for Brave: unsigned extensions cannot be installed directly. Extract the ZIP and load it as an "Unpacked" extension.
- Steps:
	1. Open `chrome://extensions` and enable *Developer mode*.
	2. Download the CRX (or ZIP) from the Releases for this repository.
	3. If you have a CRX file, drag it from your downloads into the `chrome://extensions` page and confirm *Add*.
	4. If the browser blocks CRX (or you use Brave), extract the ZIP and use *Load unpacked* to install the extension folder.

### Firefox

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in Firefox.
2. Click *Load temporary add-on* and select the ZIP file from the Releases.
3. Grant the requested permissions for the addon to work.

### Notes

- The README documents manual installation from the Releases page (CRX/ZIP). For distribution to a wider audience consider publishing to the Chrome Web Store and Mozilla Add-ons (these require packaging and store-specific steps).
- The extension works by setting `allowfullscreen` on YouTube iframe embeds and then reloading the iframe so fullscreen is available when the embed/site didn't enable it.

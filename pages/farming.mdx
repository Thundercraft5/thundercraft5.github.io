# 🌱 What farming means to me

> [!QUOTE] The ultimate goal of farming is not the growing of crops, but the cultivation and perfection of human beings.

Farming to me is not just a means, or even a way of life, it is an path and end in itself. I see the world and a dire need for integrity and sustainability, and organic, regenerative, and sustainable farming is one of the most powerful ways to achieve this because it is the first and final art of mankind, it was there when we built very first our towns long ago and will always be there when we are cruising amongst the stars and colonizing mars with advanced technology far, far from Earth. It sustains our very existence in the world, it is the root of our civilization.

### How I got sparked

Over several years my passion for the regenerative food system has evolved into a unwavering conviction in its ability to profoundly heal and uplift lives. 
My journey into slow food began with Amish Farms when I was 16. It really took off when I visited Polyface Farms in Virginia, where the beauty of the place was nothing but divine, specifically the earthy, rich smell of the soil, the vibrant energy of the people, and the verdant summer landscape. 
I felt called and embraced it as my path, resonating with my childhood nature-based education and my commitment to integrity and health. 
To test the water last fall I volunteered at the Queen's County Farm Museum. Through helping with winter clean-ups, I gained a deeper appreciation for teamwork in the field. 
The next couple of years I hope to work get some more hands-on experience in the field, while also learning programming so I can integrate both nature and technology. 
I am also looking to get involved with the local community and learn more about the local food system. 

I am excited to see where this journey takes me and how I can contribute to the regenerative food system!

# My experiences this year
Throughout the year, I have engaged in various farming activities that have deepened my understanding and appreciation for regenerative agriculture. I have completed 2 WWOOF stays and am planning to apply to a farming apprenticeship in the next year or so.
